Title: Wordle (Python)
Programmer: Mihika Sakharpe, twelve years old
Description: This program is the popular Wordle 
game coded in the Python language. Users choose their
language (English or Spanish) and enter five-letter
words to try to guess the mystery word, chosen randomly 
by the computer. Through a for loop, only six tries are 
allowed, much like the original version of Wordle.
NOTE: For Spanish words, accents DO NOT count.
